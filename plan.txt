Spotify Display

Display album art, song title, artist, as well as song progress on a small display powered by a raspberry pi.

Interfaces with Spotify API using Python to get information about your music. Has a frontend powered by Vanilla JS.

The Python backend retrieves information about the currently playing song once a second. It stores this information in an appropriately arranged JSON file which is written to the disk. The JavaScript program reads this JSON file and uses the information within to build a frontend.
This information is in the following format:

{
  "device_name": "GM1913"
  "title": "Diamond Veins (feat. Sarah Rebecca)",
  "artist": "French 79",
  "duration_ms": 420120,
  "progress_ms": 32888,
  "art": {
      width: 600,
      height: 600,
      url: "https://i.scdn.co/image/ab77838d0000be022cds"
  }
  "is_playing": true
}

needs a default screen for when no music is playing

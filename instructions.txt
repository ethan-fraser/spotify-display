1. install spotipy - the python spotify api wrapper with
pip3 install spotipy

2. run the server with
python get_sporify_data.py <spotify username>

3. assuming no errors so far, open index.html in a browser.
press F12 to open the dev tools and click the Console tab.
it shouldn't have any output if nothing is wrong but if there is, this is where you will know

4. play music on spotify using the account you used to run the server... the info should show up.
